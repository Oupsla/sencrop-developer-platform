This repository contains the code that powers the [Sencrop Developers Platform](https://developers.sencrop.com).

This project is based on [NextJS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/),
 a universal website renderer.

That said, we currently only use it for its
 static exports.

# Build
```sh
npm run build
npm run export
```

# Development
To start working on the project, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
